Lesson 1: Creating Your First Prototype
=======================================

This tutorial will show you how to make prototype pages. In this lesson, we will be using the UEF public page template--but the principles apply to any of the page templates within Genesys.

Step 1: Before You Begin
------------------------

Ensure the Genesys folder is open. If you don't see `GENESYS` in the editor's Explorer pane:

1. Select **File** > **Open Folder...**
2. Navigate to your `Genesys` directory.
3. Press **Select Folder**.

Step 2: Make Your Project Folder
--------------------------------

1. Select the `projects` directory.
2. Select the **New Folder** icon. (It appears next to `GENESYS`).
3. Type the name of your project. Let's use the name `First Prototype` for this lesson.

Step 3: Make Your First Page
----------------------------

1. **Create a new page.**
    - Navigate to your `First Prototype` directory.
    - Select the **New File** icon. (It appears next to `GENESYS`).
    - Type the name of your file. Let's use the name `home.html`.

2. **Select your template.**
    - Indicate that your new file is a HTML file by selecting the language mode in the lower right of the bottom status bar. Select `HTML`.
    - Place your cursor at the top of your page and type `!` or `!!` to select either a plain HTML page template or one of the predefined design system templates.

Step 4: Add Some Content
------------------------

1. Select your new `home.html` file. It will open in the editor.
2. Start adding page content. Let's add a UEF Basic Container to show how this is done.
3. Type `uef-`. As you start typing, the *DesignSense* Snippet dropdown will appear showing all the UEF snippets. You can scroll through the list to find the snippet you want, or just type it directly to enter it on the page. Select the `uef-container-basic` snippet, press Enter, and then let's view your page.

Step 5: View Your Page
----------------------

1. Let's make sure we save the page first, so we see all of our latest updates. Select **File** > **Save** or press CTRL+S.
2. Right-click on `home.html`.
3. Select **View in Browser**.

In later lessons, we'll show you how to automatically see changes appear in your browser as you work on your pages.
