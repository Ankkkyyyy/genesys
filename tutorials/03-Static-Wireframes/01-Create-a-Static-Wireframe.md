Create a Static Wireframe
=========================

This tutorial will show you how to create static wireframes using text, images, and other placeholders.

Step 1: Layout the Page
-----------------------

Use CSS Grids or your selected design system's grid system to create the basic page layout.

Step 2: Add Generic Stubs
-------------------------

Genesys includes several snippets for quickly inserting generic stubs, including blocks, buttons, headings, lorem ipsum, and images.

To see the complete list of Genesys Stubs, type `gns-stub` anywhere within the `BODY` of the page.

Add Sketch Effects (Optional)
-----------------------------

Use the sketch effects feature to make your pages look hand-drawn.

Add Some Notes
--------------

You can add notes to anything on the page at any time. To see how to do this, check out the [Adding Notes & Walkthroughs](../01-Getting-Started/03-Adding-Notes-and-Walkthroughs.md) tutorial.
