Starting with an Existing Web Page
==================================
You can start a prototype from an existing web page. Here's how.

1. Using your web browser, navigate to the page you want to use as your starting point.

2. Use the browser's function to *View Page Source* (right-click the page).

3. Select all of the page source (`CTRL+C`).

4. In VS Code, start a new page (`File > New File`).

5. Paste the page source code into this new page (`CTRL+V`).

6. Save your page with an `.html` extension.

7. Start working on your design.
